# A barebones FLTK GUI example
This is a very simple example of using the FLTK API 

## Usage 
The usage is through command line: 
```
helloworldfltk
```

## Library requirements 
The Fast Light Toolkit (FLTK) is a ]cross-platform C++ GUI toolkit](http://www.fltk.org/index.php) for Windows, Linux and MacOS. It provides modern GUI functionality without the bloat and supports 3D graphics via OpenGL and its built-in GLUT emulation. 

## Other requirements
[A Find_FLTK.CMake hack file](https://oceanai.mit.edu/svn/moos-ivp-aro/releases/moos-ivp-4.2/MOOS/cmake_modules/FindFLTK.cmake) was needed. This has also been included within other libraries that utilise FLTK such as [IRTK](https://wwwhomes.doc.ic.ac.uk/~dr/software/download.html)
